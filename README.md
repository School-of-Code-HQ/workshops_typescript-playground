# TypeScript Playground

## Task 1

To bundle and serve the website, globally install parcel on your computer by running the following command in your terminal:

`npm install -g parcel-bundler`

Mac users may have to add `sudo` to the start of the command, and type their password to get permission to install the module. More information about parcel can be found here: https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html

## Task 2

To serve the website run the command `parcel index.html` from the project folder. Create a 'start' script in your package.json, so that you can run your website by typing 'npm start' in your terminal.

## Task 3

Experiment with TypeScript!

Have a go at doing the following things:

- Declare variables of the types `boolean`, `string` and `number`.
- Declare variables that are the type of number array and string array.
- Declare an array which contains multiple data types.
- Declare a function where the parameter type and return values are checked.
- Declare a new interface and use it.

See how you can break the Typescript functionality as much as use it correctly. Learn what it can and can't do!
