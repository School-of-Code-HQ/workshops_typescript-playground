# TypeScript Playground

## Task 1

Experiment with TypeScript!

You can read the basics of transitioning from regular JS to TypeScript [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).

Then work through the [basic tutorial on the TypeScript docs here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-tooling-in-5-minutes.html). You can also look through this [five minute article](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/learn-typescript-in-5-minutes-13eda868daeb).

Then navigate to the [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) and have a go at doing the following things:

- Declare variables of the types `boolean`, `string` and `number`.
- Declare variables that are the type of number array and string array.
- Declare an array which contains multiple data types.
- Declare a function where the parameter type and return values are checked.
- Declare a new interface and use it.

See how you can break the Typescript functionality as much as use it correctly. Learn what it can and can't do!

## Task 2

Once you've finished experimenting, work through [this course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-typescript) as a pair.
